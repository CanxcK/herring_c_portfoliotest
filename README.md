Repo for Final Project: Portfolio

[Project Description] 
This is my personal Portfolio Website that holds all my recent and featured work. The purpose of this website is to showcase that work and have the possibility of somebody coming across it and hiring me! On the front page my most featured and best work will be put up front so that the viewer of the website sees my best work first. A

After viewing my porfolio website if anyone would like to contact me there is a form below which allows anyone to fill it out and ask anything from a simple question to an actual project need.
